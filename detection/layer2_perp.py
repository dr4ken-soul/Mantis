"""
Detection Layer 2: Perp Perspective and Index Manipulation

Analyzes derivatives market conditions including OI-to-market-cap ratio, volume anomalies,
price suppression followed by vertical moves, order book thinness, and cross-exchange
index weight exploitation.

Market makers influence mark price through exchanges that carry large weights in the
price index. When exchanges like Bitget or Gate carry significant index weight they become
easy targets for manipulation. Suspended deposits/withdrawals on these exchanges can
isolate the market and allow manipulation of Binance perp pricing from cheaper venues.
