"""
Detection Layer 3: Funding Rate Dynamics

Analyzes funding rate patterns across exchanges to detect crime pump setups.

Market makers with effectively unlimited margin profit by pushing spot prices
on exchanges with the highest index weight to create deeply negative funding rates.
This forces short holders to pay funding continuously.

A negative 2% funding rate every 4 hours translates to approximately 12% per day
paid by shorts. The bot flags funding rates reaching -1.5% or deeper as a strong
crime pump signal especially when combined with concentrated spot activity on
Bitget, Gate, or Aster.
